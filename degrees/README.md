# Degrees #

Program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are using **breadth-first search algorithm**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Specification of implmented function: **

Complete the implementation of the shortest_path function such that it returns the shortest path from the person with 
id source to the person with the id target.

- Assuming there is a path from the source to the target, your function should return a list, where each list item 
is the next (movie_id, person_id) pair in the path from the source to the target. Each pair should be a tuple of two strings.
- If there are multiple paths of minimum length from the source to the target, your function can return any of them.
- If there is no possible path between two actors, your function should return None.
